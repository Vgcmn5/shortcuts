This is because iOS 26 has fixed the issue with transparent menu icons that Toolbox Pro worked around.\r\n\r\n*If you are not able to update to iOS 26, this may result in the settings menu icons not rendering properly. If this is an issue for you, please let me know on RoutineHub.","Release":"September 20, 2025"}
